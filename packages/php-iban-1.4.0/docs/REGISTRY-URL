To get the latest ISO13616 IBAN registry as a .txt file
for parsing, go to:
 http://www.swift.com/solutions/messaging/information_products/directory_products/iban_format_registry/index.page?lang=en
... then follow the '.txt format' link.

Unfortunately, it has been noticed in 2011 that the official .txt file is
not an accurate representation of the PDF format specification, and lacks
some information. It is hoped that in future SWIFT will be more careful to
publish only correct standards information.
